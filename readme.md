The Table section is working fine when it was added or remove also the local storage is updating fine
There are some issue is there in the Item section
    1) is Item should not updating means The default Item should be 
    Item 1
        Item name = Name
        Item Cost = cost 
        it should be like and if the new Item is add 
    Item 2
        Item Name = Name
        Item cost = cost
    
    2) Point is storing the data in the local storage 
        key = items {
            itemNO : item 1,
            itemName : Name,
            itemCost : cost
        }
